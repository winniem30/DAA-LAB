# Design and Analysis of Algorithms Lab (DAA-LAB)

Welcome to my DAA Lab project repository! This repo contains implementations of sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort and Selection Sort, created using Apache NetBeans.

## Project Structure
- `sorting/` â€” Contains all sorting algorithm source files (`.java` files).
- `README.md` â€” This file.

## Algorithms Implemented
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort

## How to Run
1. Open the project in Apache NetBeans.
2. Compile and run the Java files inside the `sorting` folder.

## About Me
Iâ€™m a computer science student passionate about algorithms and software development.
